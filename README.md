# HOMELAB Diagramming-and-Physical-Setup

OBJECTIVE

The diagram is an essential component of any proposed network. Here I will use draw.io to create a diagram of my planned home network. I anticipate that the network will be updated often, and this will be my primary documentation of the changes. This will assist me in gaining hands-on experience in implementing physical networks as well as tracking network updates. This diagram is a bit of a mess but it is a working document. Most recently I have successfully networked all 3 of the computers, created a shared folder and installed Parrot Linux on a USB for easy access on my old Wni 10 laptop.

SKILLS ACQUIRED
Network Planning and Diagramming
TOOLS USED
draw.io - a free, open source network diagram app. Versatile and easy to use!

I am going to reconnect my network as shown to take advantage of the features of the NETGEAR switch. The Cisco switch is a dinosaur but it is good to know Cisco systems.

To connect the guest network I will run a cable thru the attic to the front room and connect a second router.
