# HOMELAB Diagramming-and-Physical-Setup

OBJECTIVE

The diagram is an essential component of any proposed network. Here I will use draw.io to create a diagram of my planned home network. I anticipate that the network will be updated often, and this will be my primary documentation of the changes. This will assist me in gaining hands-on experience in implementing physical networks as well as tracking network updates. This diagram is a bit of a mess but it is a working document.
