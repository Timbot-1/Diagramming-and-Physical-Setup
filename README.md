# Diagramming-and-Physical-Setup

OBJECTIVE

The diagram is the most important component of any proposed network. Here I will use draw.io to create a diagram of my planned home network. I anticipate that the network will be updated often, and this will be my primary documentation of the changes. This will assist me in gaining hands-on experience in implementing physical networks as well as tracking network updates.

draw.io - a free, open source network diagram app. Versatile and easy to use!
